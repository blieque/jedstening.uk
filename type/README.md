# Typefaces

~~I cannot simply redistribute commercial fonts in the repository, unfortunately. You may place your own copies of the required fonts here if you like, otherwise the website will default to an OS-dependant serif typeface.~~

Sod that. Argent CF is redistributed in the `production` and `gh-pages` branches. Hunt me down, Connary!

I have a license to use the fonts, but this doesn't give everyone the right to. Sorry, the project isn't entirely open.
